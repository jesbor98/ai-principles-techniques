# Sorting simulations

Code to run simulations on Insertion Sort and Selection Sort and measure the amount of array comparisons and array assignments. See the BKI259 lecture notes on complexity for these algorithms. In the practice assignment you will be asked to write a programming report on the simulations. When run on a csv-file with arrays, the code will sort them according to Insertion Sort and Selection Sort and report on the number of array element comparisons and array element assignments. See the course manual for instructions on writing the report.

Currently, code is available for C++; will be extended to Python and Java versions.
